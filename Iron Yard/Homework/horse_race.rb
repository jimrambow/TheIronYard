#Rules:

#Must use at least two classes
#Must have at least 4 horses (All horses can NOT be different classes!
#User input must affect at least one horse's speed
#Must out put the horses' paths (even as simple as "---'horse 1'") as race progresses
#Goals: classes, methods, passing arguments to methods, thinking about the design and how classes interface with each other, DRYness, making a complete & interesting & good program
