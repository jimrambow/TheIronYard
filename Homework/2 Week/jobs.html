  <h1>The good ones</h1>
  <h2>Ive worked at many great places, with great managers and a good team around me to help me with achieving success in this world.</h2>
  <ul>
    <h3>
    <li>
      McAllisters Deli - kitchen cook, great manager and a great father figure, taught me a lot about life</li>
      <br>

      <li>
        Harpers Restuarant - In the center of 5 points in Columbia there is a small restuarant named Harpers. I only worked there for about 8 months, but it was one of the best jobs ever. The managers were really down to earth. The food was farm to table, great wine selection, always amazing specials. Only downside to that job was the fact that I had to wear 100% cotton button-downs. They made you sweat in 60 degree heat.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        The Shelter Kitchen + Bar - Probably the most insane crew, the most unorganized managers, and by far the most eclectic group of back of the house kitchen staff I have ever run across. What was co-workers turned into a second family very fast here. As long as you treated others with respect, you got it back. Not an easy job, but definitely a good one.

  <h1>The bad ones</h1>
  <ul>
    <h3>
    <li>
      Cold Stone Creamery - I got this job when I had just turned 15 and was able to legally work. Within 6 months when I was about to work after 10 at night, the owner had my best friend and I closing down this ice cream parlor on our own. I was counting drawers and making sure the safe was balanced as well as making sure 3 to 4 other workers were doing what needed to be done and making sure orders were done on time. Ended up only making 7$ an hour (back when the minimum was $5.25) so I told them that was to much work for a kid my age and quit!</li>
      <br>
    <li>
      Wild Wing Cafe - If you like the place, look away now. All I will say is sub-par food, sub-par health standards, and manipulation of tips. One of the worst companies I've ever worked for...I spent 2 years at 3 different locations, and it was the biggest waste of time of my life.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Guy Harvey's Island Grill - First and foremost, if you ate here, I apologize. This was a disaster from the start. The entrance was a gigantic fucking gift shop to attract tourist's, half the time, they didn't know it was a restuarant...which was probably for the better. The chefs at Guy Harvey's I dont even remember, and I can name almost all the chefs I've met. None of them were anything special. Nothing that was a special on the menu was anything particularly special. That place was just destined to failure.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      Liquid Highway Car Wash - The only reason I put this on my bad list, is because of how we were used as people. For instance, they only hired 3-4 white guys to drive cars out of the cleaning bay to give to customers and hired mostly illegal immigrants besides that. So while I had to do all the cleaning the others had, I also had to pull the car around and listen to the Mount Pleasant snob bitch about having to much or to little tire shine on his tires...
