Ideas for final project.



Point of Sale
  - A PoS system that can be more manageable via managers and staff.
  - A menu that people can create via forms and also add amounts of that specific food. Like a specialty that we only have a certain amount of.
  - Drinks, beer, liquor, drink specials
  - An 86 button to get rid of an item in the menu because it is sold out, or have had bad feedback from a customer.
  - If a delivery company show route to location and estimated time.



A calendar that keeps track of daily activities and if you miss something will force you to do something else that is beneficial to your health, mental strength, or food, depending on what you missed. Say you missed a workout because you had a meeting, if they overlap, it would tell you to do say 20 pushups, 20 lunges, and 20 pull ups. 
 


Communication form for companies like small start ups, that have to communicate with their customers needs. 
  Example: Instead of having to email back and forth and whatnot, possibly build a way to let them draw out a baseline of what they would want and send it to them via picture.
